What's this? A game inside of a game?

The original Monophobia game was made in 2020 for #LOWREZJAM. I decided to put this game with Monophobia Echoes because I thought maybe that could be some cool extra content.

It's a bit funny how I include both games but they run on completely different game engines.

Anyways, I decided to open source the original Monophobia, not sure why though, I guess you can look into the game's secrets, improve my terrible coding or something(?), or just look at the game in general.

Here's the link: https://github.com/Infiland/Monophobia

It would be funny if people made branches and added their own phonecalls inside the game, those are always welcome.

What? There's a phone in the game you ask? Oops, I guess I spoiled that for you, sorry.
Have fun regardless!
