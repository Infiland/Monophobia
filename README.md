# Monophobia
[Monophobia](https://infiland.itch.io/monophobia) is a horror game I made for the [LOWREZJAM 2020](https://itch.io/jam/lowrezjam-2020), it's premise being to make a game under
a 64 x 64 resolution. It has 7 endings. I decided to open source the game as I am working on a 3D sequel on a brand new engine
